<h1>Analysis data files</h1>
<p>This tutorial describes and explains what data files are produced
as a result of the random walk analysis. In the following text 
<code>template</code> is used as a default graph name or an argument
of <code>-template</code> option.</p>

<h2>Graph analysis</h2>
<p>Results of the graph analysis are these files:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>template_info.txt</code></li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><code>template_deg.txt</code></li>
    <li><code>template_in.txt</code> (directed graphs only)</li>
    <li><code>template_out.txt</code> (directed graphs only)</li>
</ul>

<p><b>template_info.txt</b><br/>
This file contains summary information about the graph. Here (<a href="examples/template_info.txt">template_info.txt</a>)
is an example of such a file (this file was produced by RWTester version 0.1alpha).
</p>

<p><b>template_deg.txt</b><br/>
This file contains data dependency how many vertices have the given degree.
Here (<a href="examples/template_deg.txt">template_deg.txt</a>) is an example of such a file.
If we use this file as an input for <a href="visualization.html">ChartGenerator</a>
this image (<a href="images/template_deg.png">template_deg.png</a>) will be the result.
Meaning of the degree for directed graphs is sum of both in and out degrees.
</p>

<p><b>template_in.txt</b><br/>
The same as above but for in-degree only. This file is produced for directed
graphs only.
</p>

<p><b>template_out.txt</b><br/>
The same as above but for out-degree only. This file is produced for directed
graphs only.
</p>


<h2>Random walk analysis</h2>
<p>Results of the random walk analysis are these files:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>template_coverage.txt</code></li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><code>template_degree_visited.txt</code></li>
    <li><code>template_in_degree_visited.txt</code> (directed graphs only)</li>
    <li><code>template_out_degree_visited.txt</code> (directed graphs only)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><code>template_degree_time.txt</code></li>
    <li><code>template_in_degree_time.txt</code> (directed graphs only)</li>
    <li><code>template_out_degree_time.txt</code> (directed graphs only)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><code>template_degree_time_length.txt</code></li>
    <li><code>template_in_degree_time_length.txt</code> (directed graphs only)</li>
    <li><code>template_out_degree_time_length.txt</code> (directed graphs only)</li>
</ul>

<p><b>template_coverage.txt</b><br/>
This is data dependency in what time the given graph coverage was achieved.
For example 50% of a graph coverage means that exactly one half of all vertices
were at least once visited by the running random walk. Let's have a look at this
line:
</p>

<pre>
50    129680
</pre>

<p>This means that 50% graph coverage was achieved after 129680 steps of
the random walk.</p>

<p>Here (<a href="examples/template_coverage.txt">template_coverage.txt</a>)
is an example of such a file. Notice that the border of the random walk was
90% graph coverage. So the coverage higher than 90% has the time equal to zero.
<a href="visualization.html">ChartGenerator</a> result for this file is
here (<a href="images/template_coverage.png">template_coverage.png</a>).</p>

<p><b>template_degree_visited.txt</b><br/>
This data dependency means how many avarage visits have all vertices with
the given degree. Meaning of the degree for directed graphs is sum of both in and out degrees.
There are two more files for directed graphs: template_in_degree_visited.txt
and template_out_degree_visited.txt.</p>

<p><b>template_degree_time.txt</b><br/>
This data dependency means in what avarage time all vertices with
the given degree were first visited by the random walk. Meaning of the 
degree for directed graphs is sum of both in and out degrees. There are two 
more files for directed graphs: template_in_degree_time.txt
and template_out_degree_time.txt.</p>

<p><b>template_degree_time_length.txt</b><br/>
This is data dependency of a ratio of the first visit time and length from
the starting point of the random walk on the degree. The length of a vertex
from the starting point is computed by BFS algorithm. Meaning of the degree for 
directed graphs is sum of both in and out degrees. There are two more files 
for directed graphs: template_in_degree_time_length.txt and template_out_degree_time_length.txt.</p>
